# CodeNest-HackOps
Mental Wellness Journal for Code For Change hackathon

# Project Overview
The Dynamic Wellness Journal Website is an interactive platform designed to help users track their mental and physical well-being through journal entries. The website provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing users to document their emotions, activities, and progress over time. By storing journal entries in a database, users can revisit past reflections, recognize patterns, and gain insights into their wellness journey.

# Development Progress
The front-end design has been fully completed, and back-end development is currently in progress. The main focus is integrating MongoDB with the Node.js backend, implementing authentication, and ensuring data security.
